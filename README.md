# AI Based Body Measurement App 

**Final Year Design Project (FYDP)** **Department of Information Technology** **University of the Punjab, Gujranwala Campus (PUGC)** **Session: 2022-2026** **Project ID: FYDP-BSCS-2507**


## Project Overview
The **AI Based Body Measurement App** is a mobile solution designed to make custom-fitted online retail shopping convenient and accurate. By leveraging AI-driven pose estimation, the app extracts precise body measurements (chest, waist, hip, and arm length) from images. 

To ensure maximum user privacy, all AI model execution and measurement calculations are performed **on-device** using edge computing.

### Key Features
* **AI Pose Estimation:** Real-time keypoint tracking using TFLite and Google ML Kit.
* **Privacy-Centric:** No images are sent to a server; all processing happens on the local device.
* **Cloud Integration:** Secure user authentication and historical data storage via Firebase.
* **Size Recommendation:** Personalized dress size suggestions based on extracted measurements.
* **Modern UI:** Developed with Flutter following Google Material Design 3 guidelines.
